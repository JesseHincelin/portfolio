# Portfolio - front-end

The front-end of my personal portfolio website.

## The idea behind this project

When I started to look for apprenticeship, it became clear that I needed a way to display my skills throught my projects. The portfolio is a very commun and basic solution to that.
Moreover, it is a usefull tool once I'll get on the job market to advertize myself to companies, or potential customer if I decide to go freelance at some point. There was only good reasons to do a portfolio website and no bad reason.

## About the project

Developed with React.js and React/Redux.js.

At the time of the creation of this portfolio, I don't have much to show, so one important idea is to make and admin side to the web site, allowing me to update the state of projects, add new ones, and edit informations in general whithout going through the code.
This imply to save the porjects informations in a database through the server side : https://github.com/JesseHincelin/portfolio_server

There is of course a showcase part to the website. I want it to be a bit modern, original, light on the information displayed and easy to navigate.
